    <h1>Making the Page</h1>
    <p>This Project started out actually as a checklist on how to make a WEB page using Github.
        Hectic classroom instructions, lost half way through the first minute, PC freezes midway
        while trying to keep up with the pace.... sound familiar? <br>
        Instead of just taking snips and notes of the stages for myself, I thought "Why not help out
        the next guys?"<br>
        So following is "my version" of the "Making a WEB page using HTML, CSS, JS with Github"
        Hope it helps someone out!!
